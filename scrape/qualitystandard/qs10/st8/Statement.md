Quality statement 8 (placeholder): Hospital discharge care bundle {.title}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### What is a placeholder statement? {.title}

A placeholder statement is an area of care that has been prioritised by
the Quality Standards Advisory Committee but for which no source
guidance is currently available. A placeholder statement indicates the
need for evidence‑based guidance to be developed in this area.

### Rationale {.title}

Hospital discharge care bundles are designed to ensure that every person
leaving hospital receives the best care. They emphasise the key
interventions in the management pathway, including details of settings
for care and treatment. There are several elements of ongoing care that
an adult with COPD should start before discharge from hospital, which
can improve their outcome. There is currently a lack of evidence‑based
guidance about the details that should be included in these care
bundles. **[new 2016]**
